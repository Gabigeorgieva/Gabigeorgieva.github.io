<h1>Gabriela's Design Document</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This website will serve as a portfolio to showcase my design skills and various 
    artwork/digital design I have done throughout my years so that I can have something to 
    show recruiters when I graduate and am looking for a job. It will provide a space for recruiters 
    to learn more about me, see my skillset and decide if I seem like a good fit for their company. 
    If they decide I am, it will have my contact information so that they can easily reach out to me
    and start a dialogue which could hopefully lead to a job offer. It would help show the employers 
    clearly and quickly whether I had the skills needed for the job they are looking to hire for. 
    It would also provide a space for others outside the work field to contact me if they are looking 
    to hire design help because I am a freelance artist on the side. This would not only help get me a 
    job but also build me into looking like a true professional on my own. Most importantly though, by 
    looking at my portfolio the employers would gain the knowledge they needed that would help determine 
    if I was an adequate candidate for the position they were wanting to fill.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h4>Use 1: Find Employee</h4>
<p>On Monday, the University of Missouri recruiter will report back to work on to find out they need to 
    fill a position on their web design team. He looks posts the job and applications start quickly coming 
    in. He looks through each applicant and rules out the ones without a portfolio. He then starts looking 
    at each portfolio, eventually coming to mine. He would land on the home page which tells him who I am 
    and what my specialties are. He can then scroll down and the first thing he will see is a little copy 
    about me and an image link to my portfolio page. He can scroll more and there will list specific options
     on my portfolio page such as Web Design, Logos, Advertising and Artwork. Each section would have a link 
     image to take him to the specific page that showcases that part of my portfolio. He clicks on the 
     Web Design image link since that is what interests him most since that is what he is hiring for. 
     He will be taken to the page where he can scroll through images of each web design project I have 
     showcased and can read more about each project by clicking on the image he wants to know more about, 
     and it'll take him to another page that only showcases that specific website. He can scroll through 
     and see the images of the site showcased and read the copy that compliments it. In the end, 
     there will be a link to the actual web site so that he can visit it himself if he chooses to. 
     He decides he's seen enough from being on my site and that I have the skills needed so he goes to 
     the contact page on the top navigation bar and finds my information. He then sends me an email to 
     set up an interview.</p>
<h4>Use 2: Find Artist</h4>
<p>On Saturday, a soon to be mom is decorating her baby's bedroom. She decides she needs to find some 
    paintings for the walls because they feel bare. She doesn't want a typical picture that anyone could 
    buy from the store, she wants something original and sentimental made specifically for her new baby. 
    She goes online and googles artist in Columbia and my website comes up. She clicks on it and is taken 
    to the home page. She would land on the home page which tells her who I am and what my specialties are. 
    She can then scroll down and the first thing she will see is a little copy about me and an image link to 
    my portfolio page. She can scroll more and there will list specific options from my portfolio pages 
    such as Web Design, Logos, Advertising and Artwork. Each section would have a link image to take her 
    to the specific page that showcases that part of my portfolio. She clicks on the basic Portfolio page 
    because she decides she wants to see everything I do before deciding on what she wants. She is taken 
    to the portfolio page that again lists the portfolio options by showing the main image for each page 
    option. She decides artwork is the most applicable to what she is looking for, so she clicks on the 
    artwork image and is taken to the artwork page. There it will showcase images of some of my favorite 
    piece of art that she can scroll through and look at. She decides I have the skills needed to make her 
    baby's custom painting and wants to reach out. She goes to the contact page on the top navigation bar 
    and finds my information. She then sends me an email to set up a consultation and ask about pricing.</p>
<h4>Use 3: New Logo</h4>
<p>On Tuesday, a new café shop is about to open up in Columbia, Missouri. The owner needs to get a logo 
    made for the shop but doesn't have a lot of money to spend. She goes online and googles graphic 
    designer in Columbia hoping to find something cheaper than if she hired a big company to do it for 
    her and my website comes up. She clicks on it and is taken to the home page. She would land on the 
    home page which tells her who I am and what my specialties are. She can then scroll down and the 
    first thing she will see is a little copy about me and an image link to my portfolio page. 
    She can scroll more and there will list specific options from my portfolio pages such as Web Design, 
    Logos, Advertising and Artwork. Each section would have a link image to take her to the specific page 
    that showcases that part of my portfolio. She clicks on the logo page because she decides she wants 
    to only see what is applicable to what her business needs. She is taken to the logo page where it 
    will showcase images of some of my favorite logos that I have done for clients that she can scroll 
    through and look at. She decides I have the skills needed to make her café's new logo and wants to 
    reach out. She goes to the contact page on the top navigation bar and finds my information. 
    She then sends me an email to set up a consultation regarding the logo and to ask about pricing.</p>
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience of this webpage will be recruiters in Columbia, Missouri looking to hire and 
    fill design positions at their company. They can be male or female and are usually in the 25-40 
    age range. For a living, they are recruiters for their company and they love their job because they 
    get to meet new creative minds every day. Hobbies include spending time with family and doing outdoor 
    activities in Columbia. Primarily this website will be ideal for recruiters who have a computer and 
    internet access at work. A printer would not be needed because nothing would need to be printed from 
    the website. I will send in the link to my website with my resume whenever I apply for a position. 
    They would not have any prior knowledge about me, but they would know their company and what their 
    company is looking for, so they would be looking to hire someone that would be the best fit.</p>
<p>Below is the list of website resources utilized as good and bad examples of design:</p>
<ul>
        <li><a href="https://joshmiller.com.au/work/kojai" target="_blank">https://joshmiller.com.au/work/kojai</a><br>
        <p>Josh Miller's is a really good website example to me because it's not only beautiful, but it has very clear 
            Navigation at the top and the color scheme is fun and used very well throughout the whole site. 
            If a recruiter went on his site they would be able to easily see his skill set and contact him.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.alexcoven.com" target="_blank">https://www.alexcoven.com</a><br>
        <p>Alex Coven's website is a really good example for me. I like how the navigation is hidden on 
            the side, but I worry that it could be hard to find for some people because it is not clearly 
            labeled. If a recruiter was on his site, they would see his skill set but may have trouble 
            finding how to contact him because it's in the hidden side navigation. If it's too difficult 
            they may decide it's not worth it and not reach out.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.annaxphotography.com/" target="_blank">https://www.annaxphotography.com/</a><br>
        <p>Anna's website is a photography portfolio. I like how she uses her photos as the main content 
            on the page because that shows that they are of most importance. I personally like seeing a 
            little more color, I think she could have utilized the beautiful color from her header 
            throughout the whole site but keeping everything else white does keep the site looking very 
            clean. If someone was looking for a photographer instead of art like use case 2 they would 
            clearly be able to see if her style matched with theirs and easily find her contact 
            information to further the dialogue.</p></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.rleonardi.com/" target="_blank">http://www.rleonardi.com/</a><br>
        <p>This website was very impressive with its animation and style. The artist is clearly 
            very talented, and it was interactive and fun to scroll through. That being said there 
            is no quick way to see everything and everything is very busy so it's hard to know what 
            to look at in my opinion. I wish some parts could have been a little more simplified or 
            had an option at the end that shows everything without having to scroll through the whole 
            website to find what you're looking for. A recruiter would still probably be very impressed 
            and there is easy contact navigation at the top but if they were looking for something 
            specific it could be a little frustrating or overwhelmed with everything on the site.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.danielspatzek.com/viita_titan" target="_blank">https://www.danielspatzek.com/viita_titan</a><br>
        <p>I think this site would be a bad example for me. The text is cluttered and hard to read 
            and when you scroll there is a big paragraph that just follows you, but you can't read 
            it because the images it scrolls over takes away the readability. The interaction is nice, 
            but I just don't think it was done with ease of reading intention which is important to a 
            website portfolio. The color scheme and is constant which is good but because of all the 
            cluttered text, if someone was looking for a logo like in use case 3, they probably wouldn't 
            know where to look and you would lose their business.</p></li>
      </ul>
<h2>Needs Assessment</h2>
<p>In determining whether a portfolio website would be helpful for the intended audience, 
    a survey was administered four individuals based on my target audience were interviewed on the topic. 
    All four of the individual work in the web design field and two of which have the ability to 
    hire people.</p>
<h3>Interview Questions:</h3>
<p><strong>Why would a portfolio website be important to you if hiring?</strong></p>

                the applicant's qualifications.</li>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
            <li>It would be reviewed for every applicant if it were available to view.</li>
            <li>This would help determine if the person was right for the job or not.</li>       
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What specific content would you be most interested in?</strong></p>
<p>Responses included:</p>
<blockquote>
    <ul>
            <li>The websites that an applicant has made to ensure they have a solid grasp of the 
                website design process as well as meeting the client's expectations.</li>
            <li>If it comes to coding, show what languages and parts of applications you worked on.</li>
            <li>Variety in the work.</li>

<p>Responses included:</p>
<blockquote>
    <ul>
            <li>A responsive website that is viewable on various devices and viewports would stand out the most.</li>
            <li>Design as a coder would make you stand out, coders aren't good at communication or design, and being 
                a female coder that can do all that would make you stand out since it is a male-dominated field.</li>
            <li>A portfolio that showed the applicants ability to be flexible and adapt to different ideas/concepts 
                to create a modern website.</li>

    </ul>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Based on the survey results, I will continue to pursue a portfolio because it confirmed just how 
    important it is for the hiring process. It will include the following pages:</p>
<h4>Home Page:</h4>
    <p>This page would introduce the website. It will include a little basic information about me 
    and give the viewer the choice to go to the portfolio page or the specific options of my portfolio: 
    Web Design, Logos, Advertising and Art.</p>
<h4>Portfolio page:</h4>
    <p>This page would list the different options of my portfolio, so the viewer can pick what's most applicable to them to view.
        Web Design Page: This page would showcase a list of the websites that I have made. 
        You'd click on them to learn more about each.</p>
<h4>Web Design Page:</h4>

<h2>Presentation of Information</h2>
<p>The website will contain one home page and separate pages that will connect 
    users with the information they are looking for.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Home Page:</strong><br></li>
        <p>This page would introduce the website. It will include a little basic information 
            about me and give the viewer the choice to go to the portfolio page or the specific 
            options of my portfolio: Web Design, Logos, Advertising and Art. I'm planning on the 
            list of items from my portfolio to be image links instead of buttons that take the user 
            to a separate page related to that content.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Welcome Statement</li>

            Portfolio and Contact me will also be listed at the top navigation bar for easy use so 
            that it doesn't require the user to scroll a lot if they don't want to.</p></li>

<h2>The rationale of Organization</h2>
<p>Design elements and colors will be consistent throughout all pages. Color choices will represent 
    the colors of my brand. Navigation buttons will be on the top of every page for easy access. 
    A link to the home page will also be provided at the bottom of each page or a back to top button 
    on the side of the bottom so they don't have to scroll a lot if they don't want to. Having the 
    portfolio divided the way I did makes the information easier to consume for the viewer. 
    Since I do a lot of different things, if I simply lumped everything together it would look very 
    disorganized and the viewer would have a hard time finding exactly what they were looking for.</p>
<h2>Media</h2>
<p>I will use my own images and graphic design when possible. If not possible, I will use images that are 
    free for use on Pixels.com or Unsplash.com. These sites don't require you to cite your source but if 
    I needed to I would on the link or in the footer. Pictures will be used to a link to a lot of sections 
    and then also to showcase all my work. It will also help make things more visually appealing to the 
    viewer, since this is a portfolio website, visual appeal is very important. Pictures of teachers will 
    be taken by myself.</p>
<h2>Color Scheme and Rationale</h2>
<p>Recently I have made some business card that portray what I want my brand to be pretty well. 
    I made my resume to watch visually and color wise, so I would want my colors for my website to 
    be the same as that so that everything goes together nicely. My background color will be either 
    white, a light grey or purple/blue color, the header color will be mint green or white and the buttons 
    (if any, will be the purple/blue). I plan to use these greys, purple/blues, mint greens, and whites throughout the 
    whole site for consistency and visual appeal.</p>
