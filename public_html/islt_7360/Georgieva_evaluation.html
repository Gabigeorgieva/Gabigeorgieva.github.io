<h1>Gabriela's Website Evaluation Report</h1>
<h2>Evaluator Participants:</h2>
<h3>Richard Zimbalist</h3>
<p>Richard Zimbalist was my first Evaluator. I know him from my ComoWebDesign, LLC internship job that 
I work for; he is my employer. I figured he would be a good person to look it over because he works with 
websites on a daily basis. Richard started the company on his own about 2 years ago and has now made 
websites for many clients. He not only understands design and what makes a website look good but also 
the basics of coding through using WordPress. He used an Apple MacBook Pro with 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 
processor and 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 of memory to conduct this test with a safari browser and WIFI connection. </p>
<h3>Abbey Gorsage</h3>
<p>Abbey was my second evaluator and I met her way back in my high school art class. She is one of the 
main art teachers at Rock Bridge High School here in Columbia and has taught me a lot of what I know about 
design. Though she may not know a lot about coding she does understand design principles and has been 
teaching the high school art class for almost 8 years now, so I thought she would give me good insight on 
the design elements of my website. She said she used a Mac Book air on a Google Chrome browser and home 
WIFI connection to conduct this test for me.</p>
<h3>Patrick Davis</h3>
<p>Patrick was my third evaluator and I met him at my other web design internship job at MBS. I thought 
he would be qualified to conduct this test because he is the team lead for the insight division and has 
been coding/doing his job in the web design field for over many years now. He works with many university 
bookstores to create responsive and nice-looking websites for them. He said that he used a Sony PC running 
Windows 7 on Google Chrome with the work WIFI connection to conduct this test.</p>
<h2>Evaluator Participants:</h2>
<p>Overall, I got pretty positive feedback on my webpage. Some of the main elements that were mentioned 
had to do with the content on the pages and the links. For the multimedia elements on the page, all my 
evaluators deducted a point because they felt like there could be more on my portfolio page that I could 
have showcased. Evaluator 1 suggested that they would like to see more element on the page related to each 
section. I can see how this would be an issue popping up because I did shorten the site a lot and 
originally all the content was going to be separated in its individual pages but after reading the replies, 
I could still probably add some more content on that page. Another issue that was mentioned was the 
loading speed, some of the evaluators said that the large images probably could have loaded a little 
faster. Since not all WIFI is as strong as the other it's important that the pictures load fairly quickly 
no matter the connection of server. An evaluator suggested that I make the file size smaller to help with 
the loading speed without changing the actual size of the image. Another point that was brought up, which 
I was aware of, was the active link color on the navigation bar. The evaluators said that it was hard to 
tell what page you are on without the visual cue at the top so that would be something that would need to 
be fixed. Some mentioned that they wished there was more copy to read either about me or the content which 
could be done on the portfolio page. I was expecting this as I haven't done the contact page yet which is 
where my about me information was going to go but I could add more copy on some of the other pages to 
explain to the viewer what they are looking at. This would give my site more in-depth content that 
encourages them to stay and return to it so that they wouldn't deduct a point in that section. 
Something else the evaluation shed some light one was whether the site displayed sound design principles. 
Overall everyone seemed to like it for the most part but one of the evaluators deducted a point 
because of the way the images get blurry when you hover on them. They said the hover effect didn't 
give them enough time to enjoy the displayed artwork which made it hard to take in the content. 
Another evaluator commented on the responsiveness of the homepage header and mentioned that it 
could look better when the screen gets smaller but overall really liked the design.</p>

<h2>Use Cases:</h2>
<p>I think overall based on the evaluators feedback my website did alright with my 3 use cases but 
    could be better. The purpose of the site is to display my portfolio to a recruiter, or art buyer 
    or client looking for a logo. Even though everyone seemed happy with the design, in general, they 
    all mentioned that they wish they could see more on my portfolio page. If they aren't seeing enough 
    that means the site functionality and purpose isn't doing great. A person wouldn't be convinced to 
    complete any of my 3 use cases and contact me if they aren't seeing enough portfolio pieces to be 
    satisfied. I know originally the idea was meant to be longer with more pages, but which would have 
    satisfied the concerns the evaluators had, but since I made it shorter, I'll have to change the page 
    design of the portfolio page to display more of my work so that I'm successfully supporting my 
    three use cases.</p>
<h2>Recommended/Planned changes to the design:</h2>
<h3>Showcase more of my portfolio on the portfolio page:</h3>
<p>All my evaluators deducted a point because they felt like there could be more on my portfolio page 
    that I could have showcased. Evaluator 1 suggested that they would like to see more elements on the 
    page related to each section. This would help support my use cases more and make the site better 
    fit its purpose.</p>
<h3>Make image file sizes smaller:</h3>
<p>Some evaluators mentioned that the loading speed could have been a little better. By making the file 
    sizes smaller the computer won't be trying to load such a large image which will ultimately lead to 
    faster loading speed.</p>
<h3>Fix active link color on the navigation bar:</h3>
<p>The evaluators said that it was hard to tell what page you are on without the visual cue at the top 
    so that would be something that would need to be fixed. I had tried to do it, but I'll just need to 
    go back and fix it. After this is done people will better know what page they are on so that confusion 
    is avoided, and navigation can be simple and easy for everyone. Easier navigation leads to happier 
    consumers which leads to supported use cases.</p>
<h3>Add about me copy on contact me page and copy about portfolio sections on the portfolio page:</h3>
<p>Some evaluators mentioned that they wished there was more copy to read either about me or the content 
    which could be done on the portfolio page. By adding more copy on some of the other pages it helps to 
    explain to the viewer what they are looking at which helps further support my use cases. This would 
    also give my site more in-depth content that encourages them to stay and return to it and interact 
    with it more.</p>
<h3>Fix responsiveness of the header title on the homepage:</h3>
<p>An evaluator commented on the responsiveness of the homepage header and mentioned that it could look 
    better when the screen gets smaller but overall really liked the design. I'll just make this respond 
    to look a little better so that it always looks good no matter the screen size. I'm a designer so it's 
    important that every element communicates that so that the viewers truly believe I'm a good designer. 
    If they believe it then it will be more likely they will contact me and support the use cases.</p>
<h2>Reflections on your evaluation process:</h2>
<p>Overall, I thought the evaluation process went pretty well. Even though I told them to elaborate I 
    do wish some of the evaluators would have written a little more in some sections. Still, that being 
    said, I think I got lots of good tips to work with that will make my overall website look and 
    function a lot better, so I'd say it was all pretty useful to me! I learned that it can be hard to 
    get an evaluation from people because I had to remind them a lot, but that people really do care and 
    will do it for you if you ask. I also learned that by asking others to see it you will be able to see 
    more problems that you might have otherwise missed. It was useful to have both a design perspective 
    and a coder perspective because I was able to get feedback on both parts and really make sure all of 
    my website was fulfilling its purpose.</p>
