        <p>Hey there, my name is Gabriela Georgieva, or just Gabi for short, and I am a Strategic 
            Communication student at the University of Missouri with a passion for design, dogs and 
            some good Mexican food. I was raised in Columbia, Missouri since I was three. Also since 
            I was three I have had a pen and paper in hand, always drawing somethingâ€¦
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Fast forward 18 years and my love for art still holds strong. I learned that I can use my 
            passion for the world of design to work in the marketing and advertising industry. Skilled 
            in design, marketing, digital strategy and social media, I hope to use my knowledge to grow 
            and continue learning in the small town of Columbia, Missouri.</p>
